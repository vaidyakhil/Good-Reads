## Notes

### NPM and NPX
* npm the package manager for node comes with it and with it comes another command line utility npx.
* npx lets u execute packages without installations (the package should be part of npm pacakges).
* the convinient command to setup a bare bone react app: `npx create-react-app <app-name>` is a good example for the use case, it create a bare bone project and installs minm required dependancies like react, react-dom etc..
