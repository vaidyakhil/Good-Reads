## Notes

### Building and executing a Java Program

- Installing Java comes with JRE, which contains JVM and essential binaries required to run a Java program

- JVM is responsible to convert Java byte code (`.class`) files into machine specific code. JVM makes Java platform independent

- JDK, which is essential for Java development and compiling Java into JVM compatible byte code is not part of JRE and has to be installed separately

- To run a compiled Java program, only JRE is enough and JDK is not required
