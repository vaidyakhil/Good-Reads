## Notes



### Clean Code - Robert C. Martin

*  When I write functions, they come out long and complicated. They have lots of
indenting and nested loops. They have long argument lists. The names are arbitrary, and there is duplicated code. **But I also have a suite of unit tests that cover every one of those clumsy lines of code**. 
* So then I massage and refine that code, splitting out functions, changing names, eliminating duplication. I shrink the methods and reorder them. Sometimes I break out whole classes, **all the while keeping the tests passin**

* Any comment that forces you to look in another module for the meaning of that comment has failed to communicate to you and is not worth the bits it consumes
