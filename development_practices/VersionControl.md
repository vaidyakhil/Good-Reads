## Notes

- When using Branch by abstraction, once you bring an abstraction layer between client and module to be replaced, there is a good oportunity to improve unit test coverage for the module through the abstraction layer.  
  This will give a lot of confidence while swaping underlying implementations

- Branching by defination is opposite of CI, where branching means isolating your work from others and CI means exposing your work to everyone and doing your changes on top of everyone's changes as recent as possible
